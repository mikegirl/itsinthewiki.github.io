## Permabans:

A player can have their character permaban in any of the following circumstances:

 - The effects of permabans only count in three stock matches.
 - They are three-stocked in a 1v1.
 - They are three-stocked by the same person in a free-for-all.
 - If both players agree, they can permaban individial skins for a character instead of a character.

## Rules:

 - During a single session when playing on random maps, if the map is [final destination](fd.md) then a player can elect the match to be the [final game of all time](final_game.md).
 - In a free-for-all, if there are only two players remaining and it is down to one stock, then the player with the higher percentage can ask the other player to become damaged to "even it up". This is entirely optional and the player with the lower percentage can decline, but must give a good reason.
 - The first match is always a freindly and doesn't count. 
 - The second match is always a warm up and doesn't count.

### Gamepad Rules:

 - Three stocked to a player using the gamepad requires the losing player to by the winner a [chocolate bar](choc_bar.md) of their choosing.
